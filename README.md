# LagrangeInterpolationMethod-Python
The Lagrange interpolation formula is a way to find a polynomial, called Lagrange polynomial, that takes on certain values at arbitrary points. Lagrangeâ€™s interpolation is an Nth degree polynomial approximation to f(x). 
This program implements Lagrange Interpolation Method for finding a polynomial in python programming language and it's necessary to enter X & Y.  
This program shows you the graph related to the polynomial and the data.
